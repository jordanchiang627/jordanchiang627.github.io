# About Me

My name is Jordan Chiang and I am senior at the University of Washington studying **Geographical Data Science**. <br></br>
I wanted to use this page to display previous work that I have done, for both school and individual projects. My goal with these projects is to explore different industries using data analytics. I hope that these projects will be a display to potential employeers my *willingness to learn* as well as my *analytical skillset*.

## Previous Work
- Info330 Database: This was a school project that I tackled when I took Info330. It is a self created database that I created with 2 other classmates that would serve as a database for homeless shelters in Washington. 
- Puget Sound Inequality Study: An extra credit assignment for Geog245, this project took income data from 2021 and various analysis were explored. The project involved the usage of SQL and Tableau for visualization.
- NBA Draft Analysis: A personal project, this one was the first of my individual projects. This was more of a guidance on how I should regulate my projects and how to craft them. It involved 20 years of NBA Draft Data and various statistical analysis. Python and R were used for analysis, followed by a write up. 
- Risk Analysis Project: My most recent and complete project, endorsed by 2 people working in the industry. Using disaster, income, and population data, I explored which counties in Florida were at risk for insurance claim probably and how each factor impacts the chance of a claim. I utilized Python and Tableau to do this project.
