# About Me

My name is Jordan Chiang and I am senior at the University of Washington studying **Geographical Data Science**. <br></br><br></br>
I wanted to use this page to display previous work that I have done, for both school and individual projects. My goal with these projects is to explore different industries using data analytics. I hope that these projects will be a display to potential employeers my willingness to learn as well as my analytical skillset.

## Previous Work
- Info330 Database: This was a school project that I tackled when I took Info330. It is a self created database that I created with 2 other classmates
